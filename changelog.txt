1.0

* This plugin is now abandoned, and will not be further developed.
* Fixed a bug where the "Popim" button wouldn't show up when writing a
new page.

0.9

* New feature: popup windows can now have scrollbars.

0.8

* Fixed a bug involving WordPress installations that are at the root
of the site's directory structure.
* Better handling of directories overall.

0.7

* Upgraded plugin to work with Wordpress 2.1!
* Added support for Quicktag button in the TinyMCE editor!
* Better handling of directories on non-Unix systems.

0.6

* Some servers are configured to disallow fopen() calls to use a URL,
which in turn prevents getimagesize() from working with URLs. As a
fallback, the plugin will now look for files both by URL and by
filename on the local server. To support this, the plugin has a new
option: the directory on your local server that corresponds to your
website.

0.5

* Fixed a bug involving array_combine() and array_merge() that
occurred under some versions of PHP.
* Fixed a bug that kept the UI from correctly finding a generated
thumbnail image.

0.4

* The "Insert" button doesn't work with the rich visual editor. As a
stopgap measure, the "Preview" button now shows the code to be pasted
in the post, so that you can copy and paste it yourself.

0.3

* Fixed a bug that caused the wrong URL to be reported if the
image or thumbnail couldn't be found.
* Fixed a bug that cause the wrong URL to be reported if the
auto-generated thumbnail couldn't be saved.
* The "Add a popup image" link is now available when writing a new
page using the visual rich editor.
* When using the "Add a popup image" link with the visual rich editor,
the main window is no longer taken over by a second copy of the page
that allows you to choose the correct image and thumbnail.

0.2

* Now chmods thumbnails to be readable and writeable by anyone.
* Link tag now has the attribute tag set.

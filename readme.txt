The Simple Popup Images plugin allows you to add pop-up images to your
Wordpress blog.

== Description ==

The Simple Popup Images plugin allows you to add pop-up images to your
Wordpress blog. You put a thumbnail image in your post; if
a user clicks on it, a larger version appears in a separate
window.

Features that I think are cool:

* Plugin's UI makes it easy to add the image and thumbnail to your post
* Can automatically make thumbnails from a large image (requires the
GD library to be installed)
* The resulting popup window can, if you like, vanish the moment
the user clicks away from it
* Easy installation

The plugin adds a "Popup" button to the quicktags bar. If you're using
the visual rich editor under WordPress 2.1, select the "Code" tab on
the editor to see the quicktags. Click the button and a window will
pop up. Follow the new page's directions.

**Important note for visual rich editor users under WP 2.0**: There is
a known bug with the "Insert" button. What you will need to do is
press the "Preview" button and copy-and-paste the code from the "Popup
Image Code" box into your post. You can then close the popup window.

== Installation ==

1. Grab the latest version
2. Put the entire plugin folder in your wp-content/plugins/ folder
3. OPTIONAL: If you want, move the popup.php file somewhere else on
your server
4. Activate the plugin in your Wordpress admin panel
5. OPTIONAL: If you moved the popup.php file elsewhere, enter the
file's new directory in the plugin's option page
